# Creating a BOT using AWS Lex

This document shows how to create a AWS Lex BOT, this service will be integrated to Qiron robots soon.

## Creating an account on Amazon AWS Services
First of all, you will need to register on AWS Services Console, witch can be found in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pt/console/" target="_blank"> AWS Console </a>.

AWS services recommend to not use your root account (the one you registered with), to improve the security of your projects, it is wise to use IAM users, the documentation for those can be found in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html"> IAM Users </a>. This is also used when creating and communicating with bots by command line, wich will not be covered in this file, but it might be important for the ROS/Lex integration.
