# COMPILING THE AWS C++ SDK

### First of all, we should download the dependencies needed to compile and run the aws c++ sdk

#### 1. cmake
  sudo apt-get -y install cmake
#### 2. libcurl
  sudo apt-get install -y libcurl-dev
#### 3. libssl
  sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev

#### There can be one or more dependencies that you might not have, so, if the compilation points an error, just paste the output on the web, and you find a topic telling you what you are expected to have
